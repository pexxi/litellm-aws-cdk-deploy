  // Note: CDK apps are a bit different to test directly for snapshots in the same way as stacks.
  // The typical approach is to test the stack(s) synthesized by the app.
  // However, if we want to capture the cloud assembly manifest, that's a different kind of snapshot.
  // For this task, we'll synthesize the app and get the template from the stack it creates.
  // This assumes the app instance is available or can be accessed.
  // A more robust way would be to refactor the app slightly to allow stack inspection,
  // or to rely on testing the stack directly as done in the previous step.

  // Let's try to get the app instance created by the entry point.
  // This is tricky because the entry point script executes directly.
  // A common pattern is to export the app or stack from the entry point for testing.
  // Since that's not the case here, we'll re-create the app and stack instantiation for the test,
  // similar to how bin/litellm-cdk-fargate.ts does it.
